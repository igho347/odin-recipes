# odin-recipes

This website is a recipe website that has the homepage serving as a menu page with links to different recipes. 

This project is a part of my learning track with "The Odin Project",

 I showcased my knowledge and skills in html by using
 html tags and elements like:

paragraphs
Anchor
Strong
italics/emphasis
unordered list
ordered lists
images

I combined these tags and elements with various attributes like the hypertext reference "href" for the anchor element and the source "src" for the image element etc.

The main page contains links to differnt recipe pages.
Each of the recipe pages contains a brief information about the recipe and an image of the finished product, also a list of ingridients and steps of preparation. with a link to navigate back to the main page.

This project is made up of a root folder called "odin-recipes". In this folder contained my index.html file and also my README.md file. I created two directories; images/ and recipes/
recipes/ directory contains; jollof.html , fufu.html , and suya.html
images/ directory contains; jollof.jpg , fufu.jpg , and suya.jpg.
