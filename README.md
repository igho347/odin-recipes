# odin-recipes

This website is a recipe website that has the homepage serving as a menu page with links to different recipes. 

This project is a part of my learning track with "The Odin Project",

 I showcased my knowledge and skills in html by using
 html tags and elements like:
<ul>
  <li>paragraphs</li>
  <li>Anchor</li>
  <li>Strong</li>
  <li>italics/emphasis</li>
  <li>unordered list</li>
  <li>ordered lists</li>
  <li>images</li>
</ul>

<p>I combined these tags and elements with various attributes like the hypertext reference "href" for the anchor element and the source "src" for the image element etc.</p>

<p>The main page contains links to differnt recipe pages.</p>
Each of the recipe pages contains a brief information about the recipe and an image of the finished product, also a list of ingridients and steps of preparation. with a link to navigate back to the main page.

This project is made up of a root folder called <strong>"odin-recipes"</strong>. In this folder contained my <em>index.html</em> file<br>
 and also my <em>README.md</em> file. 
 <p>I created two directories; <strong>images/</strong> and <strong>recipes/</strong>
<p>recipes/ directory contains; jollof.html , fufu.html , and suya.html</p>
<p>images/ directory contains; jollof.jpg , fufu.jpg , and suya.jpg. </p>
